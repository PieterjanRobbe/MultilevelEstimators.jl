# Example

We consider the elliptic PDE with random coefficients

```math
- \nabla ( a(x, \omega) \nabla u(x, \omega) ) = f(x)
```

defined on the unit square ``D = [0, 1]^2``, with homogeneous boundary conditions ``u(x, \cdot) = 0`` on ``\partial D``. 

Assume the uncertain diffusion coefficient is given as a lognormal random field  ``\log a(x, \omega) = z(x, \omega)`` where ``z(x, \omega)`` is a Gaussian random field (see below).

    The following examples assume you have already installed the test dependencies as outlined in the [Installation](@ref) guide.

## Lognormal diffusion problems

First, we need to define a random field that will be used for the uncertain diffusion coefficient of the PDE. Fortunately, a Julia package that generates and samples from such random fields already exists.

```julia
using GaussianRandomFields
```

To specify the spatial correlation in the random field, we consider the [Matérn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matérn_covariance_function) covariance function with a given correlation length and smoothness. This function is predefined in the package. 

```julia
correlation_length = 0.5
smoothness = 2.0
covariance_function = CovarianceFunction(2, Matern(correlation_length, smoothness))
```

We generate samples of this smooth random field using a truncated [Karhunen-Loève expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karhunen–Loève_theorem) with 250 terms. To this end, we discretize the domain `D` into a regular grid with grid size ``\Delta x = \Delta y = `` 1/128.

```julia
n = 256
pts = range(0, stop=1, length=n)
n_kl = 250
grf = GaussianRandomField(covariance_function, KarhunenLoeve(n_kl), pts, pts)
```

A sample of this Gaussian random field is returned by either calling the `sample`-function directly, or by supplying the random numbers used for sampling from the random field.

```julia
sample(grf)
sample(grf, xi = randn(n_kl))
```

The keyword `xi` corresponds to the sample ``\omega`` in the defintion of the PDE.

We vizualize a sample of this random field.

```julia
using Plots
contourf(sample(grf))
```

```@raw html

```

Many more options and details regarding the generation of Gaussian random fields can be found in the [tutorial](https://github.com/PieterjanRobbe/GaussianRandomFields.jl/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial.ipynb) that accomagnies the package [`GaussianRandomFields.jl`](https://github.com/PieterjanRobbe/GaussianRandomFields.jl). 

Suppose we are interested in computing the expected value of a quantity of interest derived from the solution of the PDE. For example, we might be interested in the value of the solution ``u(x, ω)`` at the point ``x=y=``0.5.

## Multilevel Monte Carlo

The basics of any [multilevel method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_Monte_Carlo_method) is a hierarchy of approximations of the model problem with an increasing accuracy, but corresponding increasing cost. For the lognormal diffusion example, such a hierarchy is provided by solving the PDE on an ever finer grid. We define a hierarchy of Gaussian random field generators using
```julia
grfs = Vector{typeof(grf)}(undef, 7)
for i in 1:7
    n = 2^(i+1)
    pts = 1/n:1/n:1-1/n
    grfs[i] = GaussianRandomField(covariance_function, KarhunenLoeve(n_kl), pts, pts)
end
```

The corresponding system matrix that results from a finite difference discretization of the PDE with varying diffusion coefficient is returned by the `elliptic2d`-function from the [`SimpleMultigrid`](https://github.com/PieterjanRobbe/SimpleMultigrid.jl) package.
```julia
using SimpleMultigrid
z = sample(grf)
a = exp.(z)
A = elliptic2d(a)
b = ones(size(A, 1))
u = A\b
contourf(reshape(u, n, n))
```

### Creating an `Estimator`

```julia
using MultilevelEstimators
```

The main type provided by MultilevelEstimators is an [`Estimator`](@ref). This type has two parametric subtypes, `Estimator{<:AbstractIndexSet, <:AbstractSampleMethod}`, where `AbstractIndexSet` is an abstract type for the  index set, and `AbstractSampleMethod` is an abstract type for the sample method. For example, a Multilevel Monte Carlo method will have type signature `Estimator{ML, MC}`.

!!! info
    For a complete list of possible index set types, see [`IndexSet`](@ref IndexSet). For a complete list of possible sample method types, see [`SampleMethod`](@ref SampleMethod).

The main user interaction required by MultilevelEstimators is the definition of a sample function. This function must return a sample of the quantity of interest, and of its difference, for the given discretization parameter (or level) and random parameters. Here is an example for the lognormal diffusion problem:

```julia
function sample_lognormal(level::Level, ω::Vector{<:Real}, grf::GaussianRandomField)

    # solve on finest grid
    z  = sample(grf, xi = ω)
    af = exp.(z)
    Af = elliptic2d(af)
    bf = fill(one(eltype(Af)), size(Af, 1))
    uf = Af\bf
    Qf = uf[length(uf) ÷ 2]

    # compute difference when not on coarsest grid
    dQ = Qf
    if level != Level(0)
        ac = view(af, 2:2:size(af, 1), 2:2:size(af, 2))
        Ac = elliptic2d(ac)
        bc = fill(one(eltype(Af)), size(Ac, 1))
        uc = Ac\bc
        Qc = uc[length(uc) ÷ 2]
        dQ -= Qc
    end
    dQ, Qf
end
```
Thus, when the level parameter is zero, we return the value of the quantity of interest on the coarsest mesh. For a larger level parameter, we return both the difference of the quantity of interest with a coarser grid solution, and the value of the quantity of interest itself.

The sample function can only have two input parameters: a level and a vector of random parameters. For sample functions that require data (such as the precomputed Gaussian random fields in the example above), one might need to add a convenience function:
```julia
sample_lognormal(level, ω) = sample_lognormal(level, ω, grfs[level + one(level)])
```

Finally, for the construction of an `Estimator`, we also need to specify the number of random parameters and their respective distributions. For the lognormal diffusion problem, these random parameters are normally distributed.
```julia
distributions = [Normal() for i in 1:n_kl]
```

!!! info
    A complete list of predefined distributions can be found in the manual for [`Distribution`s](@ref Distribution).

An estimator for the lognormal diffusion problem can thus be created using
```julia
estimator = Estimator(ML(), MC(), sample_lognormal, distributions)
```

### Specifying options

Different options and settings can be passed on to the `Estimator` by supplying the appropriate keyword argument. For example, to set the number of warm up samples to 10, call
```julia
estimator = Estimator(ML(), MC(), sample_lognormal, distributions, nb_of_warm_up_samples = 10)
```

!!! info
    A complete list of optional arguments can be found in the manual for [`Estimator`](@ref).

!!! note

    It is easy to extend the current setup to the computation of the expected value of multiple quantities of interest, by using the keyword `nb_of_qoi`.

### Running a simulation

To start a simulation for the expected value of the quantity of interest up to an absolute (root mean square) error of `5e-3`, call
```julia
h = run(estimator, 5e-3)
```

This function will return a [`History`](@ref) object that contains usefull diagnostics about the simulation.

!!! info
    See [`History`](@ref) for a complete list of diagnostic entries.

!!! note

    By default, the simulation is performed for a sequence of larger tolerances to get improved estimates for the rates of decay of expected value and variance, bias estimation... This sequence is of the form
    ```math
    \text{tol}_i = p^{(n - 1 - i)} \text{tol}, i = 0, \ldots, n - 1
    ``` 
    with ``p>``1 and where the values for ``p`` and ``n`` can be controlled by the keyword arguments `continuation_mul_factor` and `nb_of_tols` respectively. You can disable continuation with the optional argument `continuation = false`. Our experience is that continuation is a very powerful tool when combined with a non-trivial mean square error splitting (`do_mse_splitting = true`) and variance regression (`do_regression = true`). 

!!! note

    By default, samples will be taken in parallel on all available processors (see `addprocs`). The number of processors is controlled by the optional keyword `nb_of_workers`. This can either be a fixed value, or a function, specifying the number of workers to be used on each level.

### Vizualization of the result using [`Reporter`](https://github.com/PieterjanRobbe/Reporter.jl)

MultilevelEstimators can automatically build a set of diagnostic figures based on a [`History`](@ref) file. Load the package by
```julia
using Reporter
```
and generate a report by calling
```julia
report(h)
```

If all goes well, you should now see a webpage with diagnostic information about the simulation, similar to [this one](assets/UntitledEstimator/index.html). Print-ready `.tex`-figures are stored locally under `figures/`.

## Multilevel Quasi-Monte Carlo

[Quasi-Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-Monte_Carlo_method) is an alternative way to pick the samples `omega`. The random samples in the Monte Carlo method are replaced by deterministically well-chosen points that increase the accuracy of the estimation with respect to the number of samples. A popular type of such point sets are [rank-1 lattice rules](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~dirk.nuyens/qmc-generators/), implemented here as [`LatticeRule32`](@ref). These points are used by default when calling the `QMC`-version of the `Estimator`
```julia
estimator = Estimator(ML(), QMC(), sample_lognormal, distributions)
```
Under the hood, the default lattice rule uses a 3600-dimensional generating vector from [Kuo et al](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~fkuo/lattice/index.html). It is easy to provide your own generating vector with the optional `point_generator`-argument.
```julia
estimator = Estimator(ML(), QMC(), sample_lognormal, point_generator = LatticeRule32("my_gen_vec.txt"))
```

!!! note

    The number of shifts is controlled by the `nb_of_shifts`-keyword. We recommend a value between 10 (default) and 30. The number of samples is updated carefully, with a default multiplication factor of 1.2 (instead of the standard and theoretically justifiable value 2, which we found to be too aggressive). This number can be controlled with the keyword `sample_mul_factor`. 
 
## Multi-Index Monte Carlo

It is easy to extend the lognormal diffusion example to compute multi-index differences. Instead of a difference between a fine and a coarse approximation, we now compute mixed differences.

```julia
function sample_lognormal(index::Index, ω::Vector{<:Real}, grf::GaussianRandomField)

    # solve on finest grid
    z  = sample(grf, xi = ω)
    af = exp.(z)
    Af = elliptic2d(af)
    bf = fill(one(eltype(Af)), size(Af, 1))
    uf = Af\bf
    Qf = uf[length(uf) ÷ 2]

    # compute multi-index differences
    dQ = Qf
    for (key, val) in diff(index)
        step = (index - key).I .+ 1
        ac = view(af, step[1]:step[1]:size(af, 1), step[2]:step[2]:size(af, 2))
        Ac = elliptic2d(ac)
        bc = fill(one(eltype(Af)), size(Ac, 1))
        uc = Ac\bc
        Qc = uc[length(uc) ÷ 2]
        dQ += val * Qc
    end
    dQ, Qf
end
```
All functionality is hidden in the call to `diff(index)`. This function returns a `Dict` with as keys the indices where coarse approximations must be computed, and as values `+1` or `-1`, specifying how these corrections must be added to the quantity of interest on the fine grid.

### Multi-index sets

Different choices for the multi-index sets are available: full tensor index sets ([`FT`](@ref)), total degree index sets ([`TD`](@ref)), hyperbolic cross index sets ([`HC`](@ref)) and Zaremba cross index sets ([`ZC`](@ref)). For example, total degree (TD) index sets look like this 

```@example
using MultilevelEstimators # hide
index_set = TD(2)
for sz = 0:5
    println("size parameter: ", sz)
    print(index_set, sz)
end
```

Weighted index sets are created by specifying appropriate weiths. All weights must be smaller than or equal to 1.
```@example
using MultilevelEstimators # hide
index_set = ZC(1/2, 1)
for sz = 0:5
    println("size parameter: ", sz)
    print(index_set, sz)
end
```

We can create an estimator the usual way:
```julia
estimator = Estimator(TD(2), MC(), sample_lognormal, distributions)
```
where `TD(2)` denotes a 2-dimensional index set.

Before running a simulation, we must precomputed the random fields on all indices.
```julia
grfs = Matrix{typeof(grf)}(undef, 7, 7)
for index in get_index_set(TD(2), 6)
    n = 2 .^(index.I .+ 2)
    pts = map(i -> range(1/i, step = 1/i, stop = 1 - 1/i), n)
    grfs[index + one(index)] = GaussianRandomField(covariance_function, KarhunenLoeve(n_kl), pts...)
end
```

A multi-index Monte Carlo simulation with this estimator is performed by
```julia
h = run(estimator, 5e-3)
```

### Adaptive Multi-index Monte Carlo

Instead of using predefined (weighted or unweighted) index sets, we can also construct the index set adaptively based on some profit indicator (see [6])
```math
P_\ell = \frac{E_\ell}{\sqrt{V_\ell W_\ell}}
```
where ``E_\ell`` and ``V_\ell`` are the expected value and variance of the multi-index difference, respectively, and ``W_\ell`` is the computational cost required to computed a sample of the difference.
```julia
estimator = Estimator(AD(2), MC(), sample_lognormal, distributions)
```

!!! note

    The maximum allowed indices that can be simulated can be set by the keyword `max_search_space`. This keyword should be an index set of one of the above types. The adaptive method will only find indices inside this index set, with the size parameter equal to `max_index_set_param`.

!!! warning

    When the adaptive algorithm tries to add indices outside of the set of maximum allowed indices, a warning will be printed and this index is dropped when computing the bias. This might result in a biased estimator!
 
!!! note

    Sometimes it is beneficial to add a penalization parameter to the profit indicator to avoid searching too much around the coordinate axes, and bumping into a memory constraint:  
    ```math
    P_\ell = \frac{E_\ell}{(\sqrt{V_\ell W_\ell})^p}
    ```
    with 0 < ``p`` < 1. Specify ``p`` with the optional key `penalization`.
    
!!! note

    Another useful optional key is `acceptance_rate`. When this parameter is smaller than 1, a suboptimal index from the active set will be used for further refinement. This index is chosen according to an accept-reject method: we sample a uniform random number using `rand()`, and when this number is larger than the accept ratio, we pich another index at random. Lowering the `acceptance_rate` results in an algorithm with a stronger global search behavior, and is useful when the adaptive method is stuck along one or more directions. Default value is 1 (no globalization). 
 
### Multi-Index Quasi Monte Carlo

Just as in standard Multilevel Monte Carlo, the Multi-Index Monte Carlo method can be extended to use quasi-random numbers instead, see [5]. The setup remains the same, just change `MC()` into `QMC()`. For example, a Hyperbolic Cross Multi-Index Quasi-Monte Carlo estimator can be created by 
```julia
estimator = Estimator(HC(2), QMC(), sample_lognormal, distributions)
```

## Unbiased estimation

The most recent development to MultilevelEstimators is the addition of unbaised multilevel estimators. In contrast to standard Multilevel Monte Carlo, a weighted sum of multilevel contributions is used, thus eliminating the bias in the estimator.

This requires a small change to the sample function, in the sense that it should now return the solutions for all levels samller than or equal to `level`. In the PDE example this can easily be accomplished by using Full Multigrid, see [7] and [8]. See [SimpleMultigrid](https://github.com/PieterjanRobbe/SimpleMultigrid.jl) and [NotSoSimpleMultigrid](https://github.com/PieterjanRobbe/NotSoSimpleMultigrid.jl) for basic example solvers. See also [LognormalDiffusionProblems](https://github.com/PieterjanRobbe/LognormalDiffusionProblems.jl) for a setup using Full Multigrid.

```julia
estimator = Estimator(U(1), MC(), sample_lognormal_fmg, distributions)
``` 

!!! warning

    Since this is a recent addition to MultilevelEstimators, it has not been tested as extensively as the other methods. Should you encounter any issues, feel free to submit an issue.
